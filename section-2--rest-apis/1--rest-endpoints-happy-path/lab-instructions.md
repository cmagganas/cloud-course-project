# Lab: Implement the "happy path" for Files API Endpoints

In this exercise, you will implement the REST API endpoints for the Files API.

Do not worry about

- documentation (the OpenAPI schema)
- error handling, error response status codes, or data validation, just do the "happy path" AKA assume nothing goes wrong
- using `camelCase` in request/response payloads. `snake_case` is fine for now.
- logging
- versioning

We will come back and implement these in later assignments.

## Assignment

There are 3 main parts to this assignment:

1. Implement the endpoints as shown below by their example requests and responses.
2. For each endpoint, implement the full checklist laid out in [`./api-checklist.md`](./api-checklist.md).
3. Test the happy path for each endpoint

Subsequent assignments will build on this one, adding more polish in their own checklist items.

## Assignment format

Fill in these files

```
hw/
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ files_api
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.py          # fill in
â””â”€â”€ tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mocked_aws.py    # provided, you may edit
    â””â”€â”€ unit_tests
        â””â”€â”€ test__main.py    # fill in
```

## Endpoints (implement these)

- `PUT /files/{filePath}`: Upload or overwrite a file. (see note below, why we use PUT for both create and update, and do not have a `POST` method)
- `GET /files`: List files metadata with pagination support.
- `GET /files/{filePath}`: Get a file by its path.
- `HEAD /files/{filePath}`: Get metadata of a file by its path (rather than the whole file).
- `DELETE /files/{filePath}`: Delete a file by its path.


> ðŸ“Œ **Design Note 1:** We are using PUT for both create and update options instead of POST because this API is atypical. In most REST APIs, the POST request accepts data, creates an object, and assigns it an ID. 
> 
> This is good because it's best not to allow users to have control over ID generation, e.g., to help ensure resource IDs are unique among other reasons. The fact that this is a file server makes our API a special case because it makes more sense for an API like this to have the URN be a file path rather than creating a separate URN, e.g., a UUID for each file. 
> 
> File paths already guarantee uniqueness, the ability to look up the resource, etc. So in this case, we use a PUT for both create and update operations. The PUT verb assumes that the URN is known by the user. In our case, it is.

> ðŸ“Œ **Design Note 2:**
> Technically, the fact that our URI/URNs use exact file paths as they are stored in S3 violates REST somewhat.
> As does the fact that users will likely store files with file extensions, e.g. `path/to/file.csv` which would
> match with a MIME type of `text/csv` in the `Content-Type` header, and therefore implies that the user
> can never request that the file be delivered in another format via `Accept:`.
